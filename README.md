# asm6502

This is an attempt at a MOS 6502 assembler. Continuing my trend of living in the past
with Commodore computers and such, this allows me to continue living in the past where
everything was just fun. ;-)

## Concept

This is renewal of my own brain and the joy I had using Commodore computers in the past.

## Implementation

This is done in Java and C, so far, to demonstrate languages and data representation
to my students.

Everything in this design is Java 21 and C23 compatible.

## The Language

This project is based on the [Commodore 64 Assembly Language](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Assembler) which has a 
specific format where the loading address is the first two byte in little endian format.
There are [tons of examples, forums and further documentation](https://retro-programming.com/hello-world-in-the-c64-machine-code/) all over the Internet.
